# comicreader
A minimal comic reader for the web. Watch the [demo here](https://exochron.github.io/comicreader/).

It currently supports only .cbz and .cbr comic files.
The project is tested only on firefox, but it should work in all current gen browsers.

## Controls
- Open a comic file by dragging onto or clicking on the black area.
- Use scroll wheel or cursor buttons to scroll through pages.
- Press [Space] key to flip to next page. [Shift+Space] for previous Page.
- Use [M] key to switch orientation mode.
- Use [R] key to toggle reverse mode. (Great for reading Manga ;-))

## Used Libraries
- [wcchoi/libunrar-js](https://github.com/wcchoi/libunrar-js) for rar support.
